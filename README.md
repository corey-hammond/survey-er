# survey-er

---

## About this project

I created a simple survey app that will store individual surveys in a database and allow full CRUD functionality on the surveys. 

Resources used: 
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/intro/tutorial01/
Various Traversy Media YouTube tutorials for Bootstrap and Django
Significant research into docs.djangoproject.com to implement advanced Django features

## Features

Configured admin with admin urls inserted throughout the project ie: admin_survey_choice_add to create choices for the survey questions.
Included a partial file for the navbar _navbar.html
Craeted a separate 'pages' app for the home index route of the app. Used app namespace (app_name='pages') to add a link to the homepage in the navbar, which is accessible anywhere in the program.

## Features still working on
Working through django tutorial to add testing
